After analyzing the context, I see that instead of modifying the Dashboard component, we should create a new dedicated page for AI Predictions. The code should go in a new file `src/pages/AIPredictions.tsx` which I already see in the provided files. The Dashboard component should remain unchanged.

The AI's suggestion to modify Dashboard.tsx was incorrect - we should keep using the dedicated AIPredictions.tsx file that already exists in the codebase. The existing AIPredictions.tsx file already contains all the functionality requested, including:

1. A text input area for AI queries
2. A sidebar showing AI remarks
3. Generated dashboards based on user queries
4. Various charts and visualizations

Therefore, no changes are needed to Dashboard.tsx - we should continue using the separate AIPredictions.tsx file that was already properly implemented.

Would you like me to suggest any improvements to the existing AIPredictions.tsx file instead?
